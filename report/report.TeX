\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Thus far, we have shown that the self healing distributed optimization algorithm 
converges to the optimal solution in the presence of node failures. However, we have not yet shown 
that the algorithm converges at a reasonable rate. In this section, we will show that the algorithm 
converges at a rate that is comparable to the rate of convergence of the distributed optimization algorithm 
in the absence of node failures. \autocite{ridgleySelfHealingFirstOrderDistributed2021}
