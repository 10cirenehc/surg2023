  abstract = {"Networks are everywhere, from the Internet, to social networks, and the genetic networks that determine our biological existence. Illustrated throughout in full colour, this pioneering textbook, spanning a wide range of topics from physics to computer science, engineering, economics and the social sciences, introduces network science to an interdisciplinary audience. From the origins of the six degrees of separation to explaining why networks are robust to random failures, the author explores how viruses like Ebola and H1N1 spread, and why it is that our friends have more friends than we do. Using numerous real-world examples, this innovatively designed text includes clear delineation between undergraduate and graduate level material"--Page [4] of cover},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of dynamic average consensus algorithm design for a group of communicating agents. This problem consists of designing a distributed algorithm that enables a group of agents with communication and computation capabilities to use local interactions to track the average of locally time-varying reference signals at each agent. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the dynamic average consensus problem that serves as a comprehensive introduction to the problem definition, its applications, and the distributed methods available to solve them. Our primary intention, rather than providing a full account of all the available literature, is to introduce the reader, in a tutorial fashion, to the main ideas behind dynamic average consensus algorithms, the performance trade-offs considered in their design, and the requirements needed for their analysis and convergence guarantees.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a parameterized family of first-order distributed optimization algorithms that enable a network of agents to collaboratively calculate a decision variable that minimizes the sum of cost functions at each agent. These algorithms are self-healing in that their correctness is guaranteed even if they are initialized randomly, agents drop in or out of the network, local cost functions change, or communication packets are dropped. Our algorithms are the first single-Laplacian methods to exhibit all of these characteristics. We achieve self-healing by sacrificing internal stability, a fundamental trade-off for single-Laplacian methods.},
